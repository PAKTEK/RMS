A Restaurant Management Program which can be used by admin or customer for ordering food, calculating bills, canceling placed orders, amending menus and many more.

The project is about creating a restaurant management system by using data structures in the C/C++ programming language. This management will have an
admin section and a customer section. Admin will manage the orders, bills and the menu whereas the customer will place orders and also will be able to cancel placed
orders. We have created various functions to create this management System.

We have decided that we would start working on this project by first creating structures for admin and customers having required data types. . First of all, we
will create structures by using dynamic memory allocation. Then, we will start to make various functions for admin and the customer for performing various works
like, ordering food, calculating bills, cancelling placed orders, amending menus and many more. After that, we will try gathering some information about the
various operations either from admin or customer from the admin or customer section respectively and then proceed with different operations with the program to
check the functionality of the given code used in the program.
